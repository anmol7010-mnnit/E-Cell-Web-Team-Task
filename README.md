# E-Cell-Web-Team-Task
In this project, I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to make a web site that contains two pages, first one is clone of task assigned to me and in second one i showed my creativity. First page is completely responsive and follow all rules of task assigned to me.I generally do not use instagram so the link on second page does not include any hyperlink.
